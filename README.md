## 1. Overview

This project uses Python to create a geospatial visualization (choropleth map) of inequality in Brazil.

The main script, contained in the `Brazil distribution map.ipynb` notebook, processes geographic shapefiles for Brazil and merges them with economic distribution data (likely from the World Inequality Database - WID) to generate a map that illustrates regional disparities.

The final output is saved as `brazil_map_divided.jpg`.

## 2. Repository Contents

* **`Brazil distribution map.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data loading, processing, merging, and map generation.
* **`brazil_map_divided.jpg`**: The final map image generated by the notebook.
* **`/BR_Pais_2024/`**: A folder containing the geospatial shapefiles for the map of Brazil.
* **`/WID_Data_Metadata/`**: A folder containing inequality data and its metadata, used to provide the values for the map.
* **`LICENSE`**: The project's MIT License.

## 3. How to Run

This project was developed in Python 3.13.9 but is intended to run on older versions with Jupyter Notebook.
